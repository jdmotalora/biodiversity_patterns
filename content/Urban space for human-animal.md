Problem:: Humans and animals have a long history of interaction in urban settings. Many species struggle to adapt to cities, leading to conflict with humans over basic resources like food and shelter. Urban animals often face persecution, including capture, killing, or confinement in captive environments like zoos and inadequate shelters, hindering their evolution.
The lack of human empathy and understanding towards these animals' needs worsens the situation. Urban barriers and dangers like roads, buildings, and pollution further threaten their health and survival. Confining them in unnatural spaces causes stress and behavioral changes, increasing the risk of disease transmission and aggression between species. 
Animals roaming freely generate noise and waste, causing problems for residents. Raccoons and stray dogs rummaging through trash pose sanitation concerns. Additionally, the close proximity between people and urban wildlife facilitates disease transmission. The plight of stray animals is worrying, as many are ignored or poisoned. Negligence and the lack of public shelters perpetuate their suffering.

Therefore::Promoting the collaborative creation of more urban infrastructure designed for mixed human-animal use, such as parks with dog drinking fountains, bird-accessible fountains, and recreation areas that consider the needs of different species. Making more flexible and expanding policies regulating the presence and access of pets to more public spaces such as transportation, beaches and retail stores. Implementing natural and artificial elements to create an adequate, healthy environment where animals and humans can coexist in the city. Developing urban and architectural models that consider the more-than-human dimension of those who inhabit and interact in the city.

A cultural and ethical change based on interspecies empathy, respect for animal otherness and appreciation of their contributions to the city is necessary. Implementing sterilization and identification programs for ethically managing populations of domestic animals (dogs, cats) and synanthropic fauna (pigeons, rodents). Rethinking the city as a multispecies space where animals are not excluded or segregated, recognizing their agency and interaction in urban life. Promoting an ethic of responsibility and respect towards animals.
