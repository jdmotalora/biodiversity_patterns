Problem:: Excessive waste, lack of planning, and poor lighting practices in both public and private spaces are the primary causes of light pollution. These issues can be tackled through simple behavioral changes and the implementation of low-cost technologies.

Therefore:: 1-Using motion sensors and timers to turn off lights when not needed would benefit foraging, migration, and breeding behaviors by allowing natural light cycles to regulate animals' circadian rhythms.   2-Avoiding excessive illumination preserves the integrity of interdependent ecosystems that rely on biological cues from properly timed lighting.
