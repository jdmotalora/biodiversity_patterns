Problem:: Urban areas tend to generate stressful environmental conditions for trees. Among the main factors are: the urban heat island effect leading to extreme temperatures and more frequent droughts; air pollution from vehicle and industrial emissions; paving and soil sealing causing compaction, waterlogging and impermeabilization; and salinization from the use of de-icing salts on streets and sidewalks. In addition, other sources of stress include nutrient deficiencies, root damage, lesions on bark and branches, and lack of sunlight due to tall buildings. In response, various tree species have developed multiple tolerance strategies to cope with the increasing intensity of these urban environmental stressors.

Therefore::It is advised to choose native tree species already adapted to the local climate and demonstrated to be tolerant of common urban stressors, including drought, heat, pollution, and severe pruning. Strategic placement of resilient plant assemblages along park perimeters, green belts, and roadsides enables a stepwise transition from the most stress-enduring species sited in highly exposed areas to less tolerant varieties embedded within greenspaces. Actively managing stress-resilient trees as an interconnected system is critical for assisting their gradual acclimatization to urban settings through judicious pruning, enhancing soil breathability, adequate watering, integrated pest management, and other maintenance interventions. Additionally, promoting wide species diversity both along tree-lined streets and within parks can simultaneously bolster ecological facilitation amongst plants and boost systemic resilience against outbreaks of disease.

Urban ecology principles:
5. Trees and shrubs, typically in straight lines along streets and roads, with associated animals are increasingly stressed by more traffic and diverse related pollutants.|
