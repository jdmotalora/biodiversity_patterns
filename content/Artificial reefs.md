Problem:: Coral reefs, one of the oldest and most diverse ecosystems on the planet, provide ecosystem services, including climate disaster mitigation, carbon sequestration, water and air purification, and food production that contributes to the health and well-being of populations. However, these ecosystems face numerous threats, including natural events like typhoons and hurricanes, rising water temperatures due to climate change, dredging of channels and ports, vessel grounding and anchoring, and destructive practices like dynamite fishing. These factors severely damage coral reefs, whose slow growth processes hinder recovery. As a result, there is a decrease in fishery resources and alterations in trophic networks.

Therefore:: Coral restoration techniques are diverse, with several recommended approaches including asexual propagation, larval restoration, and artificial coral reef methodologies. Among the latter, Biorock reefs utilize metallic structures where electrolytic reactions dissolve natural minerals from seawater. Concrete artificial reefs, installed in the ocean, provide another method, as do digitally manufactured artificial reefs, which are 3D-printed structures mimicking coral reef formations. Additionally, other methods are currently under development.

It is crucial to emphasize that one of the most important actions in coral reef restoration is the holistic restoration of ecosystems. In all cases, collaboration between scientists and communities has consistently yielded the most favorable outcomes
