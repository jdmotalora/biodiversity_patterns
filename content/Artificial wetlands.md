Problem:: Marine and continental wetlands are biodiversity hotspots that offer a wide array of ecosystem services, such as preserving biodiversity, purifying water, replenishing groundwater, controlling floods, stabilizing coastlines, protecting against storms, sequestering carbon, and mitigating and adapting to climate change. These ecosystems also provide cultural, recreational, and leisure values. However, the conservation of wetlands has been severely threatened by surrounding development and urban expansion processes. The construction of infrastructure, including roads, ports, and residences, along with the presence of industrial zones, has caused significant harm to wetlands, prioritizing economic growth over the preservation of these precious natural habitats.


Therefore:: It is recommended to consider the conservation and restoration of wetlands, as well as the construction of artificial wetlands, as fundamental aspects of urbanization and urban planning. Artificial wetlands can serve as versatile landscape infrastructure for wastewater treatment, flood control, and biodiversity habitat creation, offering alternative and cost-effective solutions. The two essential components of artificial wetlands are plant species and substrate medium. Plants indirectly promote the growth of microbial communities by releasing oxygen from their roots, thereby improving water quality. Substrates also have the ability to remove certain water pollutants through various processes such as ion exchange, adsorption, and precipitation. Moreover, artificial wetlands function as mechanisms for managing stormwater at all scales, fostering biodiversity and habitat creation, establishing new wildlife corridors, and integrating into the urban recreational network

Urban ecology principles:

56. Wetlands are scarce, often due to former farmer activity, and typically contain locally uncommon species tolerant of human disturbance.

60. Many streams, ponds, and wetlands have lowered water levels in a wastewater sewage-system area, and are polluted in a septic-system area containing some defective systems.
