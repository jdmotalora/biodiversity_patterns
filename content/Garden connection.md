Problem:: Land fragmentation is often carried out without considering its impact on ecosystems. Such territorial divisions promote the fragmentation of natural habitats since the lack of connectivity between green areas on properties hinders ecological continuity.

Therefore:: Avoid fragmentation of large gardens into smaller properties through urban planning policies preserves vital refuge for endangered urban wildlife. Large, contiguous green spaces enable botanical and biological diversity to flourish across generations. Subdivided lots that fragment native flora communities directly threaten vulnerable species already pressed by climate change.  Apartment courtyard habitats with well-curated native plantings engender opportunities for community building around shared green infrastructure
