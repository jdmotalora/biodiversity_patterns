Problem::Urbanization and population growth in cities present significant challenges for urban water systems. The construction and development of urban areas create impervious surfaces that prevent rainwater infiltration, increasing stormwater runoff and degrading water quality in rivers and streams. This issue becomes more pronounced with city expansion and the demand for livable spaces. Additionally, the lack of restoring natural hydrology in urbanized watersheds, increased urban heat, the absence of contaminant treatment, lack of carbon sequestration, and the absence of habitats for removing stormwater pollutants such as suspended solids, heavy metals, phosphorus, and fats and oils that can be toxic to aquatic life, are fundamental problems negatively impacting urban hydrologic cycles.

Therefore:: The construction of rain gardens is recommended as an effective nature-based solution for urban hydrological issues. These gardens capture and store rainwater, reducing runoff and improving water quality. Additionally, they provide further environmental benefits such as mitigating the urban heat island effect, treating pollutants, sequestering carbon, and creating habitats for biodiversity. They also help restore natural hydrological processes in urban areas and decrease flood frequency. Moreover, they enable the creation of attractive green spaces for communities. Regarding location, strategic placement to collect roof, patio, parking lot, and street runoff is recommended. It is ideal to use soil mixes that facilitate infiltration and include proper inlet and outlet structures. To optimize performance, selecting a diversity of perennial plants is advised, especially herbaceous plants capable of retaining and detaining rainwater that are also flood and drought-tolerant. Rain gardens represent a valuable tool for enhanced water management in urban zones. Implementation in various public and private spaces is possible.

Urban ecology principles:

58. Stormwater runoff, which cleans urban surfaces and is piped or ditched to stream, pond, or wetland, causes pulses or fluctuations in water levels and pollutant concentrations.
