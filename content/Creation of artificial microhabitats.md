Problem:: Historically, urban planners and architects have seen animals as pests or threats to eradicate, not as species with which to coexist. This has led to attempts to eliminate them or disregard their habitat needs. Many native species are forced to search for new ecological niches, often within urban areas themselves. It is a complex issue, involving negative perceptions of these animals as well as building processes and urban renewal that ignore their requirements for habitats. The uncontrolled growth of cities has replaced the habitats of small vertebrates, birds, bats and insects, while also displacing native species that used to inhabit these areas. Currently, urban "wildlife" is reduced to pigeons, cockroaches, rats, among others. This loss of biodiversity and the resulting ecological imbalances adversely affect both animals and humans.

Therefore:: The first step is to investigate which native species, like small vertebrates, birds, bats and insects have been displaced in the area and what their habitat needs are. Then, biologists, veterinarians, and architects should be involved to understand in detail the temperature, humidity, material, nearby food, and other requirements specific to each species. With this information, strategic areas can be identified to reinsert these animals, such as parks, rooftops and attics for bats and birds, community gardens to attract diverse pollinators like bees and butterflies, or building courtyards for lizards and small rodents. It is recommended to build customized microhabitats with local, eco-friendly, low-maintenance materials tailored to each group of species, whether insects, bats, birds or small vertebrates. For example, bat boxes, bird houses, bug hotels made of wood, bamboo, adobe and natural fibers. It is best if the community itself builds these modular and replicable microhabitats, with participative construction and care manuals catered to the needs of each type of species. This way, more people engage in the process while ensuring the sustainability of habitats for the variety of native urban species.
