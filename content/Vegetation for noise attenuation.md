Problem:: Excessive noise is a form of acoustic pollution and environmental disruption in urban areas. Its effects are expected to intensify, especially in urbanized zones, due to urban growth and high noise from vehicular traffic. This noise can disrupt animal communication by masking crucial signals for mating, danger alerts, territorial defense, reproduction, nurturing offspring, and hunting. Each species relies on specific frequencies that can be overwhelmed by human-made noise, impacting survival and reproduction. The most noise-sensitive species may be displaced from natural habitats, altering ecological communities.

Furthermore, chronic noise acts as a stressor, weakening animals and making them susceptible to disease and predation, threatening population survival. For humans, prolonged exposure causes hearing loss, stress, cardiovascular issues, sleep problems, diminished work and academic performance, and other health effects. Environmental noise decreases residential quality of life, interferes with recreation and culture. Therefore, mitigating urban acoustic pollution is a priority to preserve health and well-being for both wildlife and human communities.

Therefore:: To maximize noise attenuation capacity, it is essential to recognize the potential not only of forests but also of other types of cover, such as grasslands and herbaceous vegetation. A planning approach that includes compact and connected green areas, strategically located near major noise sources like transportation networks, is proposed. This arrangement not only helps mitigate noise generation and propagation in its early stages but also promotes an environment with fewer reflective urban surfaces.

In urban planning, it is crucial to avoid the loss of existing vegetation to conserve its valuable noise attenuation capacity. Additionally, seasonal variations in this capacity depending on vegetation type and soil cover should be considered. For example, leaf litter and vegetation roots contribute to creating a more porous and soft soil, allowing better absorption and dispersion of sound waves, especially at low frequencies. Grasslands and non-woody plants, such as herbs and grasses, also play a significant role by providing a matrix of stems that disperses sound. These elements can be complemented by trees and shrubs to further enhance sound absorption. A "decentralized" urban planning pattern is suggested, including small, dispersed urban nodes within the landscape, with interconnected green areas occupying the intermediate spaces.
