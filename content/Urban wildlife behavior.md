Problem:: Urban environments have dramatically altered the survival, reproduction, and communication habits of the species they host, compelling them to adapt to disturbances caused by human activity. Artificial shelters, such as roofs, pipes, and urban structures, have replaced natural habitats, while trees and green spaces serve as gathering points for urban biodiversity. The availability of food resources can positively affect reproduction, although hostile environments may hinder the success of offspring development. Humans also influence animal behavior by providing food, which can lead to issues like malnutrition and food dependency. Inadequate waste management feeds scavenger species, impacting trophic networks. Furthermore, noise and light pollution disrupt communication mechanisms and nocturnal habits in many species.

Therefore:: To contribute to urban biodiversity, it is recommended to recognize and monitor the species inhabiting these environments. Establishing planning processes that consider both ecosystem needs and species behaviors is crucial. During planning, homogenization should be avoided, and the installation of native species in the city should be prioritized.To foster successful coexistence between humans and urban wildlife, spaces that respect the specific characteristics of these species must be constructed. Additionally, educational campaigns should be conducted to raise awareness about the benefits of cohabitation and reduce negative interactions. Furthermore, involving communities in nature observation and engaging them as stakeholders in ecosystem restoration and conservation processes is essential.

Urban ecology principles:

26. Pipes and streets facilitate widespread pest movement between and into buildings.
28. Genetic adaptation and differentiation includes urban-rural population divergence, while selective forces include pollution, human-provided food, and low-frequency noise.
