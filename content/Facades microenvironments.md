Problem:: Rapid urban densification is reducing green spaces, increasing air pollution from reduced contaminant capture. Accelerated urbanization also contributes to the urban heat island effect, rising temperatures, and loss of natural habitats, leading to declining native species. Moreover, predominant impervious urban surfaces fail to capture rainfall, generating flooding. Lacking vegetation for shade or insulation, cities increasingly rely on artificial heating/cooling systems, exacerbating noise pollution. Green building facades and roofs can mitigate these issues. They provide cooling shade through plant evapotranspiration, absorbing carbon emissions, filtering pollutants, and releasing oxygen to improve air quality and the microclimate. Green surfaces also offer urban animal habitats while capturing rainwater to reduce flooding. Additionally, they supply aesthetic benefits, dampen noise as acoustic barriers, and enhance building insulation to lower energy demand. By exposing people to diverse micronbiomes, green spaces may also strengthen immune function while sustaining urban biodiversity.

Therefore:: Conduct an adequate site analysis considering climate, sun orientation and load capacity. Carefully select native plant species. Choose porous substrates like soil, wood and natural ground to enable diverse microbial colonization, avoiding processed materials that inhibit it. Incorporate geometric surface configurations to create varied microenvironments and promote biodiversity. Design stratified facades with material layers forming a gradient from exterior (drier) to interior (more humid) conditions to host different microorganisms. Provide suitable nesting, feeding and shelter conditions for animal species.
