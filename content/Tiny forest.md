Problem:: The scarcity of native green spaces, coupled with the loss of biodiversity and natural habitats, along with the population's disconnection from nature, create unhealthy urban environments that negatively affect the mental and physical health of inhabitants. In most cities, uniform landscaping like lawns dominates, offering minimal benefits to ecosystems. There is a pressing need to increase carbon sequestration through urban green spaces while simultaneously reducing the vulnerability of urban systems to natural disasters. This can be achieved through the implementation of nature-based solutions. However, current initiatives and some reforestation methods are characterized by their slow pace and low effectiveness, representing one of the main challenges for the restoration of native green spaces in urban environments.


Therefore:: Tiny forests or micro-forests are based on the Miyawaki reforestation method, which proposes the creation of  forests on plots as small as 100 square meters. These forests grow several times faster and with greater diversity than traditional methods, providing a space for urban wildlife. As part of the method, it is recommended to conduct a study of the selected site to identify native vegetation species and animal species that can benefit from the project. Next, the soil should be prepared with organic materials, such as compost made from fallen leaves and grass clippings, to a depth of 20 to 30 cm. Subsequently, a diverse mix of native tree species, including intermediate and late-successional species from local forest communities, should be selected to restore multi-layered, natural, or quasi-natural forests. The selected species should be planted densely, using as many companion species as possible to promote cooperative relationships and reduce competition for resources. Finally, it is advisable to cover the soil between the planted seedlings to prevent soil dryness, erosion, and weed growth while simultaneously providing nutrients as the mulch decomposes.
