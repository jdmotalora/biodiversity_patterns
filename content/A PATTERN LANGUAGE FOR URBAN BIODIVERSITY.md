**A PATTERN LANGUAGE FOR URBAN BIODIVERSITY**



Although urban spaces have had negative impacts on biodiversity, maintaining, managing and enhancing urban ecosystems can increase and restore biological diversity along gradients that extend from the surrounding landscape to the city center. Urban spaces are the result of the interaction between biophysical features, built infrastructure, and social processes. To achieve sustainability, it is essential to understand that people and nature are stakeholders with equal rights, capable of participating in decision making and city building . It is advisable to orient our processes towards planning that incorporates the principles of urban ecology and stakeholder participation, with the objective of conceiving and improving the territory in a sustainable manner.
