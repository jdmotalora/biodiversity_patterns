Problem::Numerous cities have encouraged car-centric development, which has greatly influenced urban planning and led to conflicts between livability and mobility. As a result, infrastructure has been built that occupies a substantial portion of developed areas, as well as urban and natural ecosystems. This has led to an increase in impermeable surfaces, air pollution, and noise levels. Furthermore, this development has diminished safety for pedestrians and wildlife, reduced the habitability of urban spaces, and fostered inactive and unsustainable lifestyles.


Therefore:: Models that reduce vehicular infrastructure within neighborhoods and prioritize active transportation modes are highly recommended. Superblocks, life circle  and X-minute cities serve as prime examples of this approach. These models propose perimeter vehicular roads connected to the city's arterial routes, while dedicating interior lanes to active transportation. By creating public spaces that foster social interaction, these neighborhoods become more sustainable and promote healthier lifestyles. Moreover, such models enhance connectivity with green and blue infrastructure, thereby increasing opportunities for the movement and habitation of native species.
