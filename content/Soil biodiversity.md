Problem:: Soil biodiversity, which constitutes 25% of total biodiversity, is a crucial reservoir of life that harbors a wide array of species, including millipedes, moles, earthworms, ants, mites, springtails, protozoa, nematodes, bacteria, and fungi. However, human activities such as the replacement of natural soil, creation of impermeable surfaces, compaction, pollution, habitat fragmentation, heavy metal-laden runoff, and the formation of heat islands are detrimentally impacting this biodiversity.

Therefore::To maintain and enhance urban environments, it is recommended to plan, preserve, and expand plant-soil systems in various settings, such as private yards, gardens, roadside verges, pedestrian pathways, parks, green roofs, green walls, and potted plants. It is crucial to avoid soil sealing and to conserve or transplant habitats that support soil biota. Furthermore, preserving leaf litter in urban soils is advised, as it promotes the growth of invertebrates, fungi, and other species that contribute to water infiltration and the retention of pathogens and pollutants. Soil not only provides food and fibers but also regulates air quality and climate, ultimately benefiting human health.

Urban ecology principles:

32. Porous low-organic-matter soils, characteristic of fill sites, predominate near roads, streets, and buildings.

33. Low organic matter in widespread fill, plus soil compaction by former construction or present human activity, strongly limits the growth of woody plants.
