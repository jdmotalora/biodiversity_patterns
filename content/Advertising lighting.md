Problem:: Inadequate regulation of advertising lighting fails to set appropriate limits on the intensity, direction, and duration of light emitted by illuminated signs, billboards, and neon displays. Consequently, these elements often emit intense light that spreads beyond their target area, invading public and private spaces. This intrusive light can have negative impacts, such as disorienting and disturbing urban wildlife, as well as affecting human health and well-being by disrupting sleep patterns and causing visual discomfort.

Therefore:: Regulate lighting levels, intensity, and types of lamps, particularly in advertising signs, billboards, and public lighting. Diminish or turn off ornamental and advertising lighting during the night, favoring directional lighting instead. Establish suitable limits and lighting standards to prevent disruption to wildlife.

Urban ecology principles:

 25. Many terrestrial wildlife species are nocturnal, avoiding daytime people and traffic, and respond to diverse changing urban lights.
