Problem:: Increasing human development and construction replaces birds' natural habitats with construction featuring large glass surfaces. This escalates collision risks for both resident and migratory birds. Collisions of birds with glass surfaces on houses, buildings, bus shelters, and other structures represent a major source of human-caused bird mortality. Higher collision risks have been documented in rural versus urban areas, possibly owing to greater bird abundance in less populated zones. Additionally, attracting birds towards windows through feeders, bird baths, and ornamental vegetation increases bird density near glass, thus elevating collision rates. Reflections in glass windows often confuse birds, leading them to crash into surfaces they perceive as open space. Particularly hazardous are those featuring reflections of natural scenery and skies. Despite the growing availability of products designed to mitigate this issue, such as glass with etched patterns, markers, and adhesive films, broader implementation and field-testing of such deterrent strategies remains necessary.

Therefore:: Avoid transparent glass panels on buildings. Opaque materials can prevent collisions. Adhesive patterns on glass alert birds to barriers. Decals of predator birds or etched, laminated, UV-coated glass also enhance visibility. Reducing nocturnal lighting on facades is advisable, as artificial light disorients avian flight paths towards glass. Careful placement of vegetation and food sources away from windows minimizes encounters.  A multifaceted approach combining deterrent panels with reduced lighting has an enhanced startling effect, acting through various mechanisms
