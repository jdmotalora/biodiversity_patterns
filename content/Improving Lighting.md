Problem::The widespread use of electric lighting, driven by urbanization, industry, and transportation networks, disrupts the natural cycles of urban and natural ecosystems. Approximately 18% of the Earth's surface is affected by light pollution, manifested in phenomena such as light trespass, overlighting, and sky glow. These issues interfere with the ability of birds and animals to navigate during migration, feeding, and mating. For plants, light serves as a cue for seasonal variation, defining their circadian rhythms and photosynthesis processes. Excessive nighttime lighting also hinders the atmosphere's recovery from air pollution and diminishes the visibility of the night sky. While nocturnal illumination is essential, the lack of planning, high levels of waste, and poor practices are the primary causes of light pollution.

Therefore::To address this issue, it is recommended to implement measures that ensure effective lighting by precisely directing it towards the intended area, providing the appropriate amount of light, and using it only when necessary. Reducing light pollution also depends on selecting the suitable color temperature and considering the application context, as well as choosing the appropriate equipment and ensuring its correct orientation and installation. These actions aim to minimize the amount of energy used for illumination and mitigate the negative effects on biodiversity

Urban ecology principles:

25. Many terrestrial wildlife species are nocturnal, avoiding daytime people and traffic, and respond to diverse changing urban lights.
