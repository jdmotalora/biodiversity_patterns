Problem::Urban blue infrastructure faces several challenges, many of them stemming from climate change and city expansion. These include increased risks of flooding and drought. Additionally, water pollution occurs due to runoff carrying urban and industrial waste. There is also loss of natural water retention and infiltration capacity in soils due to surface sealing. Likewise, severe disruptions of the natural hydrological cycle are registered. Two critical situations are added: insufficient wastewater treatment and growing demand for water resources due to population growth. Additionally, in some cases, proper management and administration of blue infrastructure is hindered. This is due to the diversity of stakeholders involved, such as water authorities, landowners, and maintenance agencies, among others. This multiplicity of interests impedes consistent administration. On the other hand, numerous urban water bodies are seen mainly as a threat or problem due to the floods or diseases they can propagate. Because of this, there are pressures to bury or fill them, resulting in the loss of their ecological value. Most of these aquatic ecosystems are used as dumps, affecting their quality and associated wildlife.

Therefore:: Blue infrastructure implementation in cities facilitates biodiversity conservation by establishing urban hydrological networks composed of interconnected small ponds or canals serving as dispersal corridors for aquatic fauna species. Additionally, restoring degraded aquatic ecosystems such as wetlands, riverbanks, and others within the city, ensuring adequate quality, flow, and vegetation, promotes their role as suitable habitats for various species. Blue infrastructure intended for flood control and water filtration can also provide secondary habitats like retention wetlands and filter strips, increasing refuge and resources for biodiversity. Supplementing it with riparian vegetation, adjacent green corridors, and wildlife crossings facilitates the movement and spread of associated flora and fauna. Incorporating criteria and infrastructure for fish migration in lotic river systems aims to preserve this biodiversity. Promoting responsible practices regarding water use and management minimizes impacts on aquatic biodiversity and wetlands. Finally, linking blue infrastructure with green infrastructure establishes broader, better-connected urban ecological networks, enhancing connectivity between the city's different natural habitats and areas.

Urban ecology principles:

60. Many streams, ponds, and wetlands have lowered water levels in a wastewater sewage-system area, and are polluted in a septic-system area containing some defective systems.

63. Streams are commonly truncated, channelized, rock/concrete-lined, flashy, in low-flow condition, and/or lost into pipes, all of which limit fish and other aquatic species.
