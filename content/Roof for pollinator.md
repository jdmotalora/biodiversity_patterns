Problem:: Innovative and effective strategies are needed to counter the current pollinator decline. Agricultural areas offer poor habitats for pollinators, while cities can provide attractive living spaces, even housing more species than rural areas. Cities can serve as refuges for pollinators, but the lack of open spaces limits efforts to promote them. This necessitates rethinking conventional urban green spaces. Cities must strive to create as many favorable pollinator habitats as possible, providing food resources and nesting sites. There is a correlation between the diversity of flowering plants and the diversity of bee species.

Therefore:: Designing green roofs  that provide nesting spaces and food resources could support populations of birds, bees, and other beneficial species. Specifically, providing supplemental structures on green roofs - such as piles of sand and dead wood - may enhance crucial pollinator habitat. Additionally, utilizing green roofs as urban refuges for specialized arthropods can promote species needing particular nesting locations. Plots installed with deeper, fine-grain substrates alongside floral enhancements could further nurture the diversity and abundance of wild bees on green roofs.

Urban ecology principles:
1. More buildings and tall structures create both more habitats and hazards for organisms.
