Problem:: The urban tree canopy has diminished due to urbanization, which contradicts the cooling needs of cities currently affected by global warming. Vegetative cover alters the energy balance of surfaces, while the city's tree structure sequesters part of the produced CO2, purifies the air and water, and improves the microclimate. Moreover, street trees are a crucial component of urban green spaces that positively impact human well-being and mental health while simultaneously providing habitat for urban wildlife. The decrease in tree species diversity and the homogenization of often non-native tree species in streets also reduces the variety of animals and fungi coexisting with trees, further exacerbating city issues.

Therefore:: Therefore, as a strategy to improve and maintain urban wildlife, it is recommended to conserve and increase the number of different tree species, ensuring that the highest proportion corresponds to native species. Native trees are more compatible with the species coexisting with them in the city and better support ecosystem functions. The diversity of trees will be proportional to the diversity of species inhabiting them. Moreover, native trees contribute more effectively to reducing the urban heat island effect and significantly improve the mental health of residents.

Urban ecology principles:

51. Trees cool air by shading wall, sidewalk and street, by transpiring water, and by accelerating airflow between tree crown and wall.
