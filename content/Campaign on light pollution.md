Problem:: The lack of awareness and understanding of light pollution leads to inefficient and harmful lighting practices that disrupt biological cycles, cause energy waste, and contribute to the loss of night sky visibility. This limited comprehension of the issue hinders the implementation of mitigation measures that promote responsible actions towards urban wildlife and resource sustainability.

Therefore:: 1. Conduct public awareness campaigns to increase knowledge of light pollution and its negative effects. 2. Involve the community in monitoring and reporting problematic sources of light pollution. 3. Develop policies and regulations to control light emissions and promote sustainable alternatives. 4. Educate on the circadian rhythms of humans and animals and the importance of light/dark cycles.

Urban ecology principles:
25. Many terrestrial wildlife species are nocturnal, avoiding daytime people and traffic, and respond to diverse changing urban lights.
