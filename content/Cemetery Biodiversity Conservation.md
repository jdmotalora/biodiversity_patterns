Problem::The increasing pressure on urban green spaces has highlighted the underutilization of the ecological potential of cemeteries. These areas are seldom recognized for their value in environmental conservation and the provision of ecosystem services. Current management lacks a comprehensive vision that balances historical and cultural value with environmental concerns, resulting in a lack of awareness regarding their significance in preserving biodiversity. Addressing tensions concerning ownership, administration, design, and uses of cemeteries, while adapting to the changing funeral needs of diverse societies, is essential. Balancing the multiple functions and meanings of these spaces is crucial: cemeteries serve as sites for burial and reflection, but also hold value as urban green areas. Integrating natural elements not only provides comforting experiences that contribute to visitors' well-being but also supports biodiversity conservation, including threatened species.

Therefore:: Cemeteries can function as urban biodiversity hotspots. By integrating them into the city’s green infrastructure as wildlife corridors, they facilitate species movement and provide valuable ecosystem services such as microclimate regulation, carbon capture, erosion control, pollination, and biodiversity conservation. Differentiated management is crucial, ranging from intensively maintained lawns to minimally managed meadows and reforested areas. Preserving old standing dead trees is vital for endangered species habitats. Allowing natural processes to occur with minimal human intervention will enable forest regeneration and enhance wildlife diversity. Reducing intensive lawn management promotes the growth of wildflower meadows. Upholding conduct guidelines that limit disturbances is essential to provide peaceful refuge for urban wildlife.

Urban ecology principles:

67. Dissimilar large greenspaces in a city contain most of the interior and uncommon native species, and are major sources for species dispersal within the city.
