Problem:: The urban heat island phenomenon is characterized by higher temperatures in cities due to a greater proportion of impermeable surfaces and limited natural ground cover. These factors diminish evapotranspiration and air circulation while increasing the storage and transfer of heat from materials to the surrounding air. Parking lots, typically constructed using vast expanses of impermeable concrete or asphalt, exacerbate this phenomenon. These surfaces amplify runoff and lack vegetation, such as trees, shrubs, and flowers, which would otherwise contribute to the filtration and purification of rainwater. Furthermore, excessive lighting in these areas intensifies light pollution and further elevates urban temperatures. Consequently, parking lots are transformed into barren, activity-deprived wastelands for both wildlife and human beings alike.

Therefore:: In the construction and renovation of parking lots, it is recommended to manage rainwater through the implementation of rain gardens and permeable surfaces. These features allow for the filtration of water contaminants and reduce runoff. Moreover, incorporating landscaped areas with plants and planting trees is suggested to increase shaded regions and permeable surfaces, providing a connection with nature. To enhance pedestrian and cyclist circulation, it is crucial to improve signage and create adequate spaces for their movement. Lighting elements should be strategically placed to minimize light pollution and encourage the efficient use of this resource. Finally, activating the space through temporary community events, such as fairs and sports activities, is proposed to promote public engagement and utilize the area effectively.

Urban ecology principles:

66. Water quantity (or hydrologic flow) and flooding of streams and rivers commonly increase with the proportion of developed land in upstream or headwater areas.

38. Widespread high soil pH from water running across concrete or mortar surfaces differentially affects mineral nutrient availability, growth of organisms, and species present.
