Problem:: The systematic destruction of certain habitats in the past has led to the elimination of many species from vast areas, relegating them to remnant or small vegetation patches. This phenomenon has resulted in severe isolation due to the lack of species exchange in urban and agricultural areas. In this context, it is crucial to identify and manage ecological corridors and habitat patches to form a network structure that facilitates species dispersal. Recent studies confirm the importance of maintaining ecological connectivity and establishing ecological networks to promote positive long-term biodiversity outcomes. Habitat patches, acting as bases for maintaining regional ecosystem stability, play a fundamental role in this process. In urban environments, the disconnection between patches manifests through various factors such as road cuts, light pollution, building blocks, temperature fluctuations, humidity, and noise. These environmental elements act as barriers, restricting species dispersal between different habitat patches. Species richness in urban wooded patches directly correlates with their size. As patch size increases, greater species diversity is observed. However, even the smallest patches have disproportionately high biodiversity value, serving as important habitats for threatened species. Despite the increased extinction risk associated with small patches, their cumulative biodiversity value remains significant. Therefore, protecting and restoring these smaller urban wooded patches is imperative.

Therefore:: Conserving wooded patches within the urban matrix, even the smallest ones, is crucial for maintaining species richness and native species. Protecting and restoring fragments of these habitat remnants can ensure representation of the range of species distributions confined to those specific environments. Protect Undisturbed Forest Patches play a fundamental role in preserving native herbs, shrubs, and animal species. Utilizing horticultural techniques to create artificial habitats compatible with human recreation can favor greater diversity of native plant species, especially mesophilic herbs. Planting native shrubs and herbs in public parks and green spaces represents an effective alternative to increase species richness.
