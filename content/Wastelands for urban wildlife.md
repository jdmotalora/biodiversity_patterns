Problem:: Urban wastelands present an opportunity to create needed urban wildlife habitats where people can experience and connect with nature. Research indicates that wastelands often support rich floral diversity and provide habitats for various animal species adapted to the unique conditions found there. In addition, wastelands may have significant conservation value due to the presence of wetlands, riparian zones, and other important ecosystems in the urban matrix. By serving as stepping stones linking patches of habitat, wastelands can play a vital role in enriching the local ecological network and countering habitat fragmentation driven by urban development. In environments deficient in greenspace and natural habitats, reclaimed wastelands can help fill critical gaps.

Therefore:: Identify abandoned sites in your neighborhood that still have spontaneous vegetation, wetlands or other valuable natural features like rocky outcrops. Then, collectively evaluate and map these sites based on specific criteria: Ecological value: Existing native vegetation, wildlife diversity, presence of rare species. Social value: Proximity to schools or homes, visibility from streets, safety and accessibility. Contribution to urban green infrastructure: Connectivity to parks or other green spaces. With this multi-criteria assessment, choose the sites with greatest potential to restore as an urban wildlife area through a community-led regeneration project. Main actions would be cleaning trash while protecting diverse vegetation, creating inclusive access points without over-intervening, and integrating the site visually and functionally with other nearby public green spaces through planting, eco-trails etc.

Urban ecology principles:

6. House plots (lots), street blocks, neighborhoods, cities, and urban regions support relatively different vegetation and associated animals at each spatial scale.
10. Plant and animal biodiversity is typically high in neglected sites, and (excluding zoos and botanical gardens) decreases with more design, planning, management, and/or maintenance.
