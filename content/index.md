Urban biodiversity loss, rapid urbanization, and climate pressures have intensified the need to integrate ecological knowledge into architectural thinking and design education. Yet, translating interdisciplinary biodiversity criteria into actionable design decisions remains difficult, partly because relevant knowledge is scattered across domains and lacks a structured format that supports learning and application.

This project organizes urban biodiversity strategies as a pattern language—recurring, context-aware solutions that connect a clearly stated problem to a design response across multiple spatial scales. To improve usability and exploration, the approach can be strengthened through semantic organization: a knowledge graph can represent patterns as interconnected concepts (nodes) and relationships, enabling more systematic navigation, discovery of links between patterns, and context-specific recommendations.
