Problem:: Roads, highways and railways primarily act as physical and biological barriers, fragmenting and dividing animal habitat. They obstruct migratory movements and daily wildlife crossings, isolating previously connected populations and reducing gene flow between them. This can negatively impact genetic diversity and viability of affected populations.

Additionally, infrastructure construction leads to direct destruction and alteration of habitats by splitting ecosystems that previously existed as continuous areas.

Vehicular traffic on roads and highways directly causes wildlife mortality from roadkill incidents. For some threatened species, roadkill mortality rates may be high enough to seriously jeopardize population persistence.

Pollutant emissions including noise, exhaust fumes and increased dust levels also degrade habitat quality near transport routes, negatively affecting wild communities.

Intensive herbicide use along road and railway margins can substantially reduce availability of wildflowers, impacting groups dependent on this floral resource such as pollinators. Artificial night lighting from traffic and power lines disorients nocturnal species, increasing their risk of perishing from roadkill when attempting to cross roads.

Therefore::To reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions and mitigate the environmental impact of transport infrastructure, structural and non-structural measures are recommended.

Structural measures include wildlife crossings such as bridges, crossing overhead cables, tunnels and culverts adapted to target species, allowing their safe passage while avoiding direct access to roads. Installation of guide fences and barriers to steer animals towards safe crossings is also useful.

Low-cost non-structural measures include warning signage at crossing zones, speed humps, speed limit enforcement, driver education campaigns to raise awareness, use of odor and ultrasonic repellents, and nighttime lighting at crossing points.

Promoting habitat connectivity via wildlife corridors and identifying roadkill hotspots to focus mitigation actions there is equally important. Monitoring effectiveness of these measures before and after implementation allows evaluating their outcomes.

Proper management of roadside vegetation can also benefit biodiversity by providing substitute habitats. Recommendations include favoring species attractive to pollinators, limiting herbicide use, and allowing some natural succession.
