Problem:: The loss of biodiversity, caused by residential, public, and industrial developments, is a key factor in its decline. In the coming years, urban population growth is expected to increase the demand for housing and infrastructure, exacerbating biodiversity loss. Habitat fragmentation, light pollution, bird collisions with glass surfaces, and noise pollution are among the most significant factors contributing to the impact of these developments on biodiversity.

Therefore::To mitigate the environmental impact of existing buildings constructed with traditional materials like brick, concrete, and steel, it is recommended to incorporate enveloping surfaces that reduce risks and promote species interaction. When planning new constructions, architects and developers should integrate activity programs that address the needs of non-human species and carefully consider the choice of materials and construction systems. Priority should be given to solutions that enhance biodiversity, minimize lifecycle impacts, reduce energy consumption, and lower the carbon and water footprints of the building. Sustainable materials such as wood, earth, and natural fibers are recommended for their ability to meet these goals.

Urban ecology principles:

77. Within a house plot, concentrating diverse land uses, maintenance regimes, and tiny structures commonly increases species richness well above that in a nearby natural area.

76. A block of highly diverse and ever-changing house plots is ecologically tied together by some repetitive plantings/land uses, plus green street side and back-boundary corridors.
