Problem:: Pavements, which account for 30 to 45% of urban surfaces, have been linked to reduced permeability, causing recurring problems in cities. These impermeable surfaces alter hydrological cycles by preventing water infiltration and increasing runoff, heightening the risk of flooding due to their low water permeability. As a result, urban streams and water bodies deteriorate from diffuse water sources, leading to the degradation of aquatic habitats. The absence of natural filtration provided by soils, which typically removes heavy metals and other contaminants from water, further exacerbates the negative impact on aquatic species.

Therefore:: To reduce the area of impermeable surfaces and control peak flow rates, allowing the entire city to infiltrate water, the use of permeable surfaces such as porous pavements, grass, gravel, porous tiles, and impermeable blocks with holes or slots is recommended. These surfaces help decrease flood risks by facilitating natural water cycles and reducing the concentration of pollutants that reach urban water bodies, thereby improving the quality of life for the species that inhabit them.
