Problem::Improper lighting direction is a major contributor to light pollution and reduced energy efficiency. The incorrect positioning of luminaires and the lack of accessories to precisely control light distribution not only increase costs and light waste but also create glare. These issues have a detrimental effect on urban ecosystems and wildlife.

Therefore:: 1-Promote the use of shielded luminaires that direct light downwards and prevent skyward scatter. This would reduce problems like light glare. 2-Reduce the intensity of artificial nighttime lighting, especially near natural areas, to avoid disrupting the timing and structure circadian rhythms of  animals

Urban ecology principles:

25. Many terrestrial wildlife species are nocturnal, avoiding daytime people and traffic, and respond to diverse changing urban lights.
