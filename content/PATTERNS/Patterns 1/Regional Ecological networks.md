Problem:: Traditional territorial planning has prioritized land use, zoning, transportation, infrastructure and economics while undervaluing ecological impacts and natural landscapes. Urban-rural divisions disregard the biomes cities occupy, rupturing interconnected ecological systems. Moreover, urban planning delimits boundaries absent of biome distributions and ecosystem connectivity, frequently sacrificing biodiversity for development. The lack of municipal conservation strategies enables incremental ecosystem disruption from encroaching cities. Rather than emphasize biodiversity protection, local authorities have treated it as optional. Inadequate safeguard integration into civic and private spaces has transpired, culminating in vanishing wilderness and shifting hydrology alongside urban expansion. The disconnect between conservation planning and biodiversity prioritization facilitates the problem. Furthermore, biodiversity preservation awareness deficiencies among both residents and planners compound issues. Recognizing extensive biodiversity safeguarding and its environmental and quality of life import must become fundamental to urban planning.

Therefore:: Establishing regional ecological networks that connect adjacent urban and rural biomes is recommended, thus strengthening connectivity between urban habitat patches through corridors that facilitate wildlife transit and propagation, mitigating habitat fragmentation effects. In urban planning, identifying and removing physical and environmental barriers to animal movement, as well as generating solutions to optimize connectivity, is essential. Identified patches can constitute the backbone of the ecological network and should be prioritized in preservation initiatives. Additionally, maximizing width and functionality of riparian corridors as preferred wildlife pathways is suggested. Prioritizing urbanization in ecologically low-value areas and safeguarding zones important for biodiversity is fundamental. On a regional scale, recognizing these zones and focusing urban expansion on environmentally less vulnerable sites is vital. Working alongside urban developers to implement biodiversity-sensitive urban design practices is key to ensuring preservation across all stages of planning and development.

Urban ecology principles:

86. Suburbs are filters of flows/movements between rural and city areas, and also key sources of flows affecting both areas.
