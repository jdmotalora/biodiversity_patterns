Problem::Although most species have been negatively impacted by human activities in the environment, some have adapted to urban areas, benefiting from the available food and shelter. This liminal fauna has adjusted its behavior to coexist with urban conditions, leading to problems such as property damage and the transmission of pathogens to humans and their pets, which has fostered conflictual encounters. These changes in dietary habits are further exacerbated by the negligent mishandling of waste and the direct feeding of wildlife by some individuals. As a result, the atypical behavioral modifications exhibited by these species create imbalances in ecosystems.

Therefore:: Feeding wild species is not recommended, as it can condition their behavior and lead to a dependence on anthropogenic food sources. Moreover, human food is often unhealthy for these animals, disrupting their natural dietary habits and trophic networks. To minimize the impact on urban wildlife, food production companies should improve their processes to avoid becoming sources of food and shelter. Organic and recyclable waste should be kept away from potential encounters with wild animals, and pets should be fed indoors. By recognizing species as inhabitants of urban and surrounding ecosystems, citizens can contribute to the preservation of biodiversity
