Problem:: The urban landscape, with its vast size, complex configurations, sprawling extent, and massive built environment, views biodiversity as a passive by-product of design rather than considering cities as integral parts of natural ecosystems.
Driven by an anthropocentric approach, impermeable constructed surfaces fragment and isolate habitats, disrupting ecological networks and obstructing the free movement of animal and plant species in urban areas. The built environment stands as a primary driver of biodiversity loss in cities. Although endangered species may enjoy legal protection, their habitats face fragmentation and isolation due to the pressures of densification. 
Laws safeguarding nature and habitats fail to account for their complexity and fragility. Although many habitats receive protection, critical corridors essential for animal and plant mobility do not receive the same consideration. Development encroaching on or near ecological networks creates movement barriers for non-human animals, severely compromising these networks. Current planning and design, centered only on human needs, produces impermeable structures that restrict species' free passage through the landscape.Modifying built surfaces to facilitate interaction between interior spaces and ecosystems could resolve many of the aforementioned issues.

Therefore:: To ensure species persistence within the built environment, existing habitats should be protected, or new urban habitats intentionally created, providing necessary resources for survival. Built surfaces interacting with ecosystems must employ treatments contributing to species recovery and conservation, transforming buildings into a positive or neutral impact on the urban ecosystem.Design thinking should center equally on human and non-human species, considering their respective requirements. Building processes should include species as stakeholders during planning and design, ensuring they benefit from new constructions. Incorporating shared habitat elements like green roofs, walls, and cladding cavities for birds and insects is recommended. These should be strategically distributed across the building envelope, considering environmental conditions, species preferences, and proximity to human spaces. Species selection for integration is crucial, initially focusing on those most likely to survive and positively interact with humans. Involving species representatives throughout the design process advocates for their needs. During construction, sites should be evaluated beforehand, and measures taken to protect existing habitats. Appropriate construction technologies and materials compatible with non-human species' needs must be selected. Redefining maintenance perceptions to accept the dynamic nature of multi-species cohabitation is essential.
