Problem::The lack of vegetation cover on streets and sidewalks reduces the environment's ability to mitigate light pollution. Green spaces, such as parks, gardens, and vegetation belts, act as natural buffers by absorbing and blocking excess artificial light.

Therefore:: Strategically planted vegetation buffers absorb artificial glare from streets to sustain biodiverse environments. Native shrubs and trees with dense canopies naturally filter excess luminance, enabling surrounding species to retain natural nocturnal behaviors integral to thriving. Although nighttime light can be a stressor for plants, implementing best practices, such as reducing light trespass and using sensors, can help mitigate its negative effects.

Urban ecology principles:

25. Many terrestrial wildlife species are nocturnal, avoiding daytime people and traffic, and respond to diverse changing urban lights.
