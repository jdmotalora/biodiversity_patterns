Problem:: Habitat fragmentation due to urban expansion, the lack of ecological corridors, and insufficient integration of green areas into city design hinder the mobility and interaction of flora and fauna. This disconnection disrupts the natural flow of energy, nutrients, and organisms, impacting the resilience and health of urban ecosystems. Furthermore, the lack of connectivity between green spaces limits the ecosystem services they provide, such as microclimate regulation, air filtration, and noise reduction.

Therefore::Establishing wide, vegetated greenway corridors with small trails along the edges provides necessary habitat resources while enabling safe animal movement between patches of preserved land.  These broad, interconnected greenbelts supply abundant food sources, nesting sites, and protective cover for local species to augment isolated habitat fragments. They facilitate migration and dispersion to maintain healthy gene flow for vulnerable populations now fragmented by urban infrastructure barriers. Wildlife corridors with short 1-2 km distances between vegetated patches also mitigate human disturbance from adjacent development, minimizing noise, light, and other pollution into natural areas.
