Problem:: The extinction of butterflies is driven by the destruction and transformation of natural environments into urbanized and agricultural areas, which is further exacerbated by the homogenization of the landscape and the loss of its biodiversity. Various anthropogenic activities contribute to this decline, including the loss of peatlands and wet meadows, increased mowing frequency, and, in some cases, reforestation with trees that block sunlight. Excessive use of fertilizers contaminates the soil, affecting meadows and water bodies, disrupting the larval development of butterflies and hindering their reproduction.

Therefore:: The creation of butterfly gardens in cities is a fundamental mechanism that contributes to the conservation and recovery of these species. It is recommended to identify the host plants of butterflies and include them in the design of gardens, balconies, and terraces, aiming to form a network of interconnected green spaces. These plants not only provide food for the butterflies but also offer them shelter and are essential for their reproduction, as some species use them to lay their eggs.
