Problem:: Cities are spaces where diverse species coexist, but urban planning often overlooks the needs of non-human species. This oversight has led to significant impacts on biodiversity and urban ecosystems, as well as conflicts between animals and humans. These conflicts include urban wildlife dependency on human-provided food, the endangerment of species, ecosystem degradation, the control of animals deemed as pests, and inadequate management of domestic animals. Furthermore, most cities worldwide lack designated spaces for the movement and interaction of different species and have an absence of urban infrastructure designed to meet the needs of wildlife.

Therefore:: Architectural activity programs offer valuable information about the actions and users involved in a building. To better accommodate biodiversity, it is recommended that existing programs be revised to create spaces that consider the needs of non-human users. When designing new architectural programs, professionals should include multi-species activities that facilitate the integration of other urban-dwelling species, while respecting their rights. Furthermore, incorporating educational initiatives that promote the connection between species and the city is crucial for preventing conflicts among them. By including diverse species in architectural programs and urban planning, cities can ensure long-term benefits for both humans and the environment.

Urban ecology principles:

80. Commercial and shopping areas, with concentrated goods, people, food, garbage, and other organic materials, sustain surrounding scavenger and pest populations.

82. Many pest insects genetically adapt to heavy pesticide use around kitchens, houses, restaurants, and food markets, as well as standing water.
