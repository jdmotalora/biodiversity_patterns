Problem::Rapid urbanization has fragmented ecosystems, disrupting migration, feeding, and breeding cycles. This fragmentation also causes collisions along natural migratory routes. Furthermore, the resulting isolation can lead to the extinction of non-human species

Therefore:: Wildlife crossings such as overpasses, and green bridges facilitate habitat connectivity fractured by roads and urban barriers. 
Ecological infrastructure allows safe passage for myriad migrating species to access fragmented territory and preserves genetic diversity. 
Benefiting biodiversity conservation, integrating natural design into transportation networks helps prevent vehicular collisions involving local fauna.
