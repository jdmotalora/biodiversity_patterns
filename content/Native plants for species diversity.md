Problem:: When introduced in urban settings, exotic plant species can become invasive, displacing native species and reducing biodiversity. Their inclusion in urban green spaces may also disproportionately favor certain generalist animal species over more specialized ones. In general, these exotic plants do not provide the same resources, such as food and shelter, as native plant species to urban wildlife. Although some native animals may utilize resources from exotic plants, these do not match the habitat and foraging value provided by the native plant species they have co-evolved with. while not all exotic species generate negative impacts, increasing the proportion of native plant species in urban green spaces promotes higher biodiversity of native urban wildlife.

Therefore:: It is recommended to increase the presence of native plant species in urban green spaces such as parks, gardens, common areas, and street trees. This is because native plants provide a broader range of resources for local wildlife compared to exotic species. Additionally, incorporating endangered or threatened native species is suggested to contribute to their conservation. This approach not only benefits urban biodiversity but also promotes the abundance and diversity of birds, insects, and other urban animals by increasing the proportion and density of these plants in parks and gardens. By opting for regional or local native vegetation, a more effective strategy is established to provide habitat and food for urban wildlife.
