Problem:: Urban green spaces are the primary habitats for wildlife in cities. In these urban ecosystems, sequential processes of species' life and death occur, which are sometimes altered by the aesthetic perceptions of human beings. An example of this is dead trees, which are often removed under the justification of representing a danger to people or simply due to aesthetic preferences, without understanding the benefits they provide to urban biodiversity. The removal of dead trees is a constant practice, as it is difficult to find places in cities where ecosystems can develop without human intervention. People generally only value trees for their role in environmental improvement and recreation, considering that this only occurs while they are alive. Aesthetic preferences towards dead wood are mostly negative, leading to its suppression in urban parks and forests.

Therefore:: Preserving standing dead trees or their fallen wood represents a benefit for the conservation of future biodiversity. If public safety concerns necessitate the felling of trees, it is not necessary to remove the trunks once they are on the ground. Dead wood provides habitats for species that depend on decomposing wood, such as fungi, insects, or lichens. In fact, ecosystems with wood in different stages of decomposition strengthen their stability and resilience. Effectively communicating the positive effects of dead wood to communities can drive an increase in urban diversity.
