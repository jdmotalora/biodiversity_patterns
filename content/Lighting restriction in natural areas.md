Problem:: Excessive artificial lighting negatively impacts natural reserves and their ecosystems. It disrupts the behavioral cycles of both aquatic and terrestrial fauna due to light pollution. This problem is further aggravated by a lack of awareness about the need to establish clear boundaries between urban zones and protected areas.

Therefore:: Establishing buffer zones surrounding wildlife habitats—within which outdoor lighting installations would face restrictions. 
Thoughtful demarcation of dark sky preserves enhances nocturnal environments that many threatened species rely on for navigation during seasonal migrations. Additionally, minimizing artificial light encroachment into wetlands protects amphibian and aquatic life cycles dependent on naturally occurring photoperiods.

Urban ecology principles: 

25. Many terrestrial wildlife species are nocturnal, avoiding daytime people and traffic, and respond to diverse changing urban lights.
