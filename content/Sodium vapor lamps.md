Problem:: Excessive lighting, along with the color and wavelength of light, poses a significant problem for urban ecosystem fauna and flora. Although lighting is essential, many current systems are not designed to mitigate their negative environmental impact. Light pollution and excessive night sky brightness are direct consequences of this issue.

Therefore:: Replace white lights with lower impact lights such as sodium vapor where possible. Promote the use of sodium vapor lamps instead of halogen or LEDs since they have less impact on wildlife.

Urban ecology principles:

25. Many terrestrial wildlife species are nocturnal, avoiding daytime people and traffic, and respond to diverse changing urban lights.
