Problem:: Urban development has significantly damaged freshwater habitats, altering hydrological cycles. Urban ponds are among the most affected habitats, experiencing a notable decrease in biodiversity. This is due to various factors, such as the increase in impermeable surfaces, species invasion, habitat degradation, water pollution, overexploitation, and flow modifications. These alterations lead to problems like eutrophication, hypoxia, and the transport of metals and microplastics through runoff, among other significant changes in urban water bodies.

Therefore::Maintaining urban ponds is recommended, as they offer various ecosystem services and serve as both permanent and temporary habitats, acting as stepping stones during species migration. To ensure proper management of these ponds, it is suggested to avoid vertical walls that hinder amphibian movement, manage communities of submerged and emergent plants, maximize connectivity with other water bodies, and prevent the introduction of non-native species. Additionally, research has shown that urban retention ponds can effectively sediment de-icing salts, capture microplastics, and trap metals through the plants inhabiting them.

Urban ecology principles:

58. Stormwater runoff, which cleans urban surfaces and is piped or ditched to stream, pond, or wetland, causes pulses or fluctuations in water levels and pollutant concentrations.

59. Most local waterbodies have intensive human use and disturbance, considerable hard edge, and a quite limited littoral area of vegetation zones with rich aquatic fauna.
