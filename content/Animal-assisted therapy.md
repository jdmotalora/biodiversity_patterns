Problem:: Correctional facilities, such as prisons and detention centers, and mental health institutions, including psychiatric hospitals and addiction rehabilitation centers, often lack natural elements that promote restorative justice or patient rehabilitation. In the specific case of prisons, green areas are usually considered a luxury rather than a rehabilitation mechanism. Spaces designed for access to the outdoors are generally limited to hardscapes or lawn areas devoid of fauna and intentional landscape design.

Therefore::Incorporating green spaces, sustainability programs, and animal-assisted interventions is recommended in correctional and mental health facilities. These initiatives promote health improvement, behavioral enhancement, and the development of emotional and vocational skills for individuals, while simultaneously benefiting ecosystems. Implementing carefully designed healing gardens within these facilities provides spaces for reflection, restoration, reconciliation, and even commemoration. Furthermore, interacting with animals has been shown to be beneficial in treating various conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, phobias, addiction issues, and violent behaviors
